This project provides a personalized experience for college students in College Station by creating unique “quests” tailored to each user's preferences. Students can input their budget, time frame, and specific interests, allowing an AI to design customized activities and itineraries that fit their lifestyle. The goal is to enhance social experiences by simplifying planning and encouraging students to explore College Station in a way that matches their unique needs.

User Interface

- Users create a profile and select interests (e.g. outdoor activities, food, art, sports).
- Users can add friends and network with others to complete quests together or compete against one another.
- Great customization in what users do not want to do, how much time they have, their possible budget, and where they want to go.

AI FeedBack

- AI usage to take time, budget, and preference inputs, predict a possible unique experience, and explain that to the user in the home page.
- Will also use a maps API to pin the location(s) of interest and create a route for the user.
- Using a maps API will estimate the potential “crowd meter” of the location selected.
- Allow users to input their feedback after a quest and use that to change future predictions to tailor more to the users preferences.

New Opportunity

- Increase incentives for users to explore new activities in the CSTAT area.
- Find new and exciting restaurants, hobbies, and activities.
- Meet new people of similar interests, compete with friends to explore and get out to new places.
- Convenience of automatically accounting for planning around budgets, changing availabilities, and different interests.
